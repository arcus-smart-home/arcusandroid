 * A Picasso target to place an image into the background of a view. This stoooooopid little class

 * WARNING, WARNING, WARNING: Correct use of this class is tricky! Picasso maintains only a weak reference to it. Thus
 * you cannot instantiate this as either an anonymous inner class, or a method local variable as
 * both instances will sometimes be garbage collected before Picasso has a chance to invoke them.
 * In this situation, nothing will happen--no error, no placeholder image, no nothing. It's
 * non-deterministic and impossible to debug without turning on debug mode.
