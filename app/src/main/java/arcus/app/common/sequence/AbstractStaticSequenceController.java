/**
 * Represents a sequence of fragments whose ordering is static, that is, the visited order of
 * fragments can be determined at the time the sequence starts. For example, the account creation
 * process is a static sequence (the set and order of "pages" is known at the start). The pairing
 * process is not (one cannot determine the set of "pages" displayed until the user has begun
 * pairing one or more devices).
 *
 * This class provides navigation and convenience methods for SequenceControllers that employ a
